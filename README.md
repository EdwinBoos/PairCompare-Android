# PairCompare - Android - OpenCV - dlib
A research project in computer vision.

Goals implemented : 
- Recognize faces (via camera) 
- Take photo, crop ROI (Region of Interest) and convert it into a .bitmap file
- Recognize face landmarks and seperate these into face features ( like chin, nose, right eye, left eye etc... )
- Compute angle of face features. ( is done with chin ).

Todos:
- Compute distance, scope, etc. of every face feature.
- I need to implement a camera frame, so we get the face angle right.
